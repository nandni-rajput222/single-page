                I'm so perplexed
                With just one breath, I'm locked in
                Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn
                I'm so perplexed
                On that, it's almost shocking
                I know, I know you know you're scared
                Your heart, your mind, your soul, your body
                They won't, they won't, they won't be careful
                But I guess that you don't know me
                Cause if I want you, and I want you, babe
                Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
                Cause space is just a word made up by someone who's afraid to get too...
                Close, ooh
                Oh, so close, ooh
                I want you close, ooh

                I am not really known for ever being speechless
                But now, but now somehow
                My words roll off my tongue right onto your lips, oh
                I'm keeping cool while you keep smiling
                Saying all the things I'm thinking
                Oh man, oh man
                I am like you so I want proof of what you're feeling
