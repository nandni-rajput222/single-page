                Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn
                I'm so perplexed

                They won't, they won't, they won't be careful
                But I guess that you don't know me
                Cause if I want you, and I want you, babe
                Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
                Cause space is just a word made up by someone who's afraid to get too...
                Close, ooh
                Oh, so close, ooh
                I want you close, ooh

                But now, but now somehow
                My words roll off my tongue right onto your lips, oh
                I'm keeping cool while you keep smiling
                Saying all the things I'm thinking
                Oh man, oh man
